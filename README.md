# Ember Styling

A simple Ember.js app for viewing and managing a baseball leage. There are 2 resources, teams and players. Both teams and players are able to be viewed, created, edited, and deleted.

Styling is done with a Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework for very fast development.

The data shown in the app is scaffolded out with Ember CLI Mirage.
